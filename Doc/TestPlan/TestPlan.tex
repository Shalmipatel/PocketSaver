This document is to describe to Testing Plan for the PocketSaver mobile application for iOS and Android

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of testing this project is to confirm all requirements that were outlined in the Requirements Specifications as well as check whether or not the requirements are met or not. This also helps to determine if the application is implemented correctly.

\subsection{Scope}
In order to test the re-implementation of CoCoin into the PocketSaver application, the test plan provides a basis and structure for the testing that is to transpire. Its objective is to prove that PocketSaver has met its requirements as specified in the Requirement Document as well as create metrics to the requirements so that the requirements specified are quantifiable. The testing plan allows for a means and structure for the testing on PocketSaver. This document will also provide what is to be tested of the application and outline testing methods as well as tools that are to be utilized for testing.

\subsection{Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Symbols}
There are no acronyms, abbreviations or symbols that will be used throughout this document that need to be highlighted. 
	
\subsection{Overview of Document}
The PocketSaver application will re-implement the project CoCoin from GitHub. The application will allow the user to enter daily personal finances in order to keep a detailed record of their transactions in everyday life. All of the applications software requirements can be referred to in the \href{run:../SRS/SRS.pdf}{Requirements Document}. This document demonstrates how the personal finance application PocketSaver will be tested, the testing schedule, and the tools that are utilized for testing.

\subsection{Software Description}
\textcolor{blue}{PocketSaver is a financing application created to keep track of personal finances. The backend of the application is coded in C\# and the front end is coded in XAML. The data collected by the user is stored in a free online database. The table below describes various components of the software that are affected when a new transaction is inputed: }

\end{table}

\subsection{Test Team}
The team as a whole will be responsible for testing. Please refer to the gantt chart for more details and responsibilities of the testing.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
We will be using Microsoft Unit Test Framework for unit testing. Microsoft Unit testing works well with MStest, which makes it easy to test with the application. The unit testing will run the program and compare the output values with the expected values.
\subsection{Testing Tools}
Testing tools that will used is MStesting unit. It is a automated testing unit.
\subsection{Testing Schedule}
Refer to Gantt chart for the testing Schedule, \href{run:../../ProjectSchedule/Gantt Chart.gan}{Gantt Chart}

Initial State: Application is on the enter transaction page
\newline
Input/Condition: User inputs their transaction details and clicks Enter
\newline
Output/Result: The transaction should update the database 
\newline
How test will be performed: When user enters a new transaction the database should update and should have accurate data. We will use unit testing to ensure the data in the database matches the information provided by the user.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
\textcolor{blue}{As we strived to accomplish, we created a smoother user interface than the existing implementation, CoCoin. PocketSaver uses an online database rather than a local one like CoCoin to ensure data integrity and save space on the user's local device. Another obstacle we had to over come was the language barrier, CoCoin was written in Mandrian, making it very difficult for us to follow along the project.}

\section{Unit Testing Plan}
The Microsoft Unit Test framework will be used to implement the unit testing for this project. This does not require any further downloads or installations because the Microsoft Unit Test framework comes installed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}

To unit test the internal functions of the PocketSaver application, the values of the API will need to be checked in order to verify that those are the correct values that are saved in the database. For example, if a user inputs a transaction, the database needs to be checked and verified that the data was inputted correctly. For any functions that have a return (example: a total expense calculation), any test cases that have the proper input provided as well as expected output will suffice in terms of testing the function. We know that all functions cannot be tested and therefore our aim is to have about 40\% of the functions to be unit tested while the others are tested manually.
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}	
Since the PocketSaver application does not produce an output file, there not a need to test in this area. There will be no unit testing of the output since display will be a direct output of the internal functions that are being run by the application in the background.
