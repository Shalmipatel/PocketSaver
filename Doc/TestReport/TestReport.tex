\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}
The nonfunction requirements were tested using a combination of manual testing, the usabilty survey we referenced in the test plan, and the feedback from the inlab presentation. Based on the feedback from the survey and inlab presentation, we made some modifications to our project and added a couple of features to better improve out application.

\subsubsection{Additional Suggestions from the Survey and inLab Feedback}
\begin{itemize}
\item {Add a today button to make it easier to enter todays date when entering a transaction.}
\item{A graph implementation to view monthly transaction}
\item{An overview of multiple months}
\item{Filter through transaction list page}
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
As we strived to accomplish, we created a smoother user interface than the existing implementation, CoCoin. PocketSaver uses an online database rather than a local one like CoCoin to ensure data integrity and save space on the user's local device. Another obstacle we had to over come was the language barrier, CoCoin was written in Mandrian, making it very difficult for us to follow along the project.

\section{Unit Testing}
Unit Testing was completed using the Visual Studios Testing Framework. The tests are located in the src directory as its own solution. There were 4 tests for the API service and 3 tests for the homepage view model. When running the unit tests, it is important to run the homepage view model tests before the API service because the API service generates new data which the homepage view model unit tests are not expecting. Therefore causing the homepage view model to fail even if its functionality is correct.

\end{figure}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}
After conducting the non functional testing, we created a today button for easier use of the entering a transaction function of the applicaiton. We also fixed a few bugs that those who took our survey caught. We ensured that the navagation between the pages was correct and smooth. Taking into account the feedback from our tests, we were able to improve our application.

\section{Automated Testing}
Automated Testing was implemented using the Visual Studios Testing Framework as mentioned above. The automated testing was implementing to ensure the API calls to the database were working. This is the core of the application since without this none of the data would be saved and nothing else would work. Therefore ensuring the API calls were working was very important.

\section{Trace to Requirements}
The tables are found at the appendix at Table \ref{TraceFR} and Table \ref{TraceNFR}.

\section{Trace to Modules}		
The tables are found at the appendix at Table \ref{ModuleTraceFR}.

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
For our application, every testcase passed, through both unit testing and manual testing. During testing both functional and non-functional requirements were tested, with normal cases and edge cases. The application has a smooth user interface, there for it was easy to validate functionality through a usability survey (inserted in this document) where targeted users tested the application. Therefore, our goal for 90\% coverage metric was reached.
